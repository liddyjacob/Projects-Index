# Data Science and Machine Learning


| Project Link | Topics | Tools / Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [MetroBeat(working title)](https://github.com/liddyjacob/MetroBeat) | Audio Visualization, Audio Signal Analysis, Machine Learning | Python(librosa, pytorch), Godot | A model built from the ground up to find the beats of a song - created after dissatisfaction with Librosas built in beat.beat\_track function. |
| [Beat the Box](https://github.com/liddyjacob/BeatTheBox) | Statistics, Audio Signal Analysis | Python(docopt, librosa, subprocess), BASH(aplay, input) | A hackathon project that turns beatboxing and cardboard box drumming into MIDI information. |
| [Cartoon Face Generator](https://github.com/liddyjacob/cartoon-face-generator) | Machine Learning, Image Analysis | Python(jupyter, PIL), TensorFlow | A Jupyter notebook to explore GAN architecture to create cartoon faces based on open source art. |
| [Dixit Image Finder](https://github.com/liddyjacob/Dixit-Image-Finder) | Statistics, Image Analysis, APIs | Python(openCV, pixabay API, numpy, docopt) | A project to select art for the tabletop game Dixit based off image similarity to the existing art cards in Dixit. | 

Many more Data Science projects are associated with my career as a Data Scientist, see my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gE-WVyc6kOUrySHWRo8kiIqfeCQYTPBG/view) for more Data Science / Machine Learning projects.

# Software Development and Engineering

| Project Link | Topics | Tools / Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Mongo Proxy Server](https://github.com/liddyjacob/MongoProxy) | Networking, Wire Protocol, API, Database Managment Reverse Engineering | Python(asyncio, bson, functools), mongoDB |  Graduate school class project. Reverse engineered and modified the mongoDB protocol. Project designed to add a new feature to mongoDB: restrict records to specified users, even if said records exist in the same database. |
| [Mini C](https://github.com/liddyjacob/MiniC/tree/master) | Compilers, Abstract Synatx Trees, Programming Theory, Modular Design | C++14, Cmake | A graduate-level course project about implementing a custom programming language. Implements the MiniC Programming language specified by [Dr. Sutton](http://asutton.github.io/), professor of Compiler Design. |
| [RSA Algorithm](https://github.com/liddyjacob/RSA_Algorithm) | RSA, Encryption, Number Theory, Algorithms | C++14, GNU Make, | An implementation of algorithms surrounding the RSA Encryption protocol, including key generation, signing files, and verifying signed files. | 

# Research

| Project Link | Topics  | Tools / Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [OPAN Finder](https://github.com/liddyjacob/OPAN_Finder_Final) | Number Theory, Research, Parallel Processing, Optimization | C++11, CMake, GMP, NTL | Implementation of the algorithms described in my 2019 Research Paper. Optimization and Parallel processing alongside mathematical discovory allowed my algorithm to solve an unsolved problem in mathematics. |
| [Research Paper](https://github.com/liddyjacob/paper) | Number Theory, Research, Technical Writing | LaTeX, Chalk, Chalkboard | An original research paper in number theory that expands on the search for odd [weird numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_number). |
| [REU Extension of Nauty Tools](https://github.com/liddyjacob/REU_Extend_C/tree/master) | Graph Theory, Low-level coding, Tool building | C, Nauty | Extension of tools avaliable in the [nauty and Traces](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) for Graph Theory research purposes. | 
| [REU Python Algorithms](https://github.com/liddyjacob/REU-Critical-Graphs) | Graph Theory, Research, Multi-Language | Python(igraph, itertools) | Algorithms for Graph Theory research associated with the 2018 Rochester Institute of Technology REU program. | 

# Games and Puzzles
| Project Link | Topics  | Tools / Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Hive TableTob Game Implementation](https://github.com/liddyjacob/Hive_python) | Object Oriented Programming, Modular Design | Base Python + Tkinter | Implementation of the Hive Board game from scratch, including graphics, rule enforcement, game state, end game detection.
| [Strategy Game AI](https://github.com/liddyjacob/cpypastas) | Object Oriented Programming, AI | Base Python | Implementation of an AI to compete amonst friends in a Age of Empires inspired strategy game. My AI won 1st place, and even won a bonus round when all other competetors teamed up against my AI. |
| [Parks Puzzle Generator](https://github.com/liddyjacob/Parks) | Logic, Reverse Engineering, Research | C++11 | Automating the generation of puzzles like those found in the app [Parks Seasons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andreasabbatini.parksseasons&hl=en_US&pli=1). |
